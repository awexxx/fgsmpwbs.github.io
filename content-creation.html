<h1>Content Creation Guidelines</h1>
        <p>This guide will list what we look for in content creators representing the FGSMP Server.</p>
<section id="about">
        <p>We look for the best creators to play and show their audiences our server. However, there are a few requirements you need to meet.<br>
        <li>Do you play a decent amount? How many hours do you have on the server?
        <li>Why do you want to be a content creator?
        <li>Do you have any previous infractions on either the Discord or MC Server?
        </li>
        <p>If you can answer all of these, you have potential to be an approved content creator!<br>
                Reach out to <a href="team#moon">Moonqii</a> to finalize this!</p>

        <h1>Content Creation Terms</h1>
                <p>At any moment of any day, the Forest Grove Team may determine you are not fit to be a creator.<br>
                        A Member from the team may reach out to you via Discord or PM you on Minecraft if we deem this. You can appeal by submitting an appeal to that member, however.<br>
                        If you believe you were incorrectly removed, please contact Moonqii.<br>
                To prevent this from happening, please follow the following rules.</p>
                        <li>Make sure to not use any slurs in your streams.
                        <li>Don't harass people in your chat and/or in game.
                        <li>Don't threaten anyone anywhere. Threats are not taken lightly.
                        <li>No bullying. Banter is allowed alongside sarcasm (if clear), but straight up threats are prohibited.
