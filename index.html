		<H2>We managed to gain a lot of players and really enjoyed our time on the Pixelmon server!<br>
		However, all things must come to an end. The Forest Grove SMP is officially closed.</H2>
		<h2>Thank you to everyone who had the littlest of interest in our mission.<br>
		Bon voyage, trainers!</h2>
		<p><i>You will be directed to the Moonqii website shortly.</i></p>
